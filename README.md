## Building the Plugin

- To build the plugin you first need to build a development version of [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker), this should be as simple as getting the source from github and opening and building the project in Visual Studio.
- The next step is to build the plugin, double clicking `PluginExample.sln` will open the project in Visual Studio.
- First thing to do is add a reference to the location of your Hearthstone Deck Tracker executable (compiled in the first step).

- Add another reference for the `HearthDB.dll` found in the same directory as the Hearthstone Deck Tracker executable.
- You should then be able to build the plugin successfully.
- Go to your `PluginExample\bin\Release` folder and copy `PluginExample.dll` to the Hearthstone Deck Tracker Plugins folder.
